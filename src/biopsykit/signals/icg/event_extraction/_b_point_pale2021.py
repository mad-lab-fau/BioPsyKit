    """B-point extraction algorithm by Pale et al. (2021).

    This algorithm extracts B-points by first determining a search window based on the C-point location and the
    C-point amplitude in the dZ/dt signal. Afterward, the algorithms searches for either the local minimum closest to
    the C-point or the first point at which the slope of the signal exceeds a certain threshold. If no criterion is met,
    the search is repeated with a less strict slope threshold. If still no B-point is found, the algorithm
    returns the signal minimum in the cardiac cycle before the C-point.

        This algorithm extracts B-points by transforming the ICG signal using a weighted time window applied to the

        B-point, facilitating B-point identification.

        icg : IcgRawDataFrame
            The raw ICG signal data.
        heartbeats : HeartbeatSegmentationDataFrame
